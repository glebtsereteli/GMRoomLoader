## Library
* Live data for current room and persistent rooms. Waiting for [this bug](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13362) to be fixed.
* :Screenshotting: expansions with `.ScreenshotSprite()`, `.ScreenshotSurface()`, and `.ScreenshotBuffer()`. Working with [Collage](https://github.com/tabularelf/Collage) and dynamic texture groups via [texturegroup_add()](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Drawing/Textures/texturegroup_add.htm).
* Batch-loading Instances and Tilemaps for heavy rooms.
* `.Part(left, top, right, bottom)` state - :Loading: and :Screenshotting: parts of rooms. 
* Prefabs integration (when they eventually come out).

## Demos
