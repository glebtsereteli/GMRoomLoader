# Upcoming Features

The following list of ideas includes features that might or might not be introduced in the future. If you have a feature you'd like to suggest, please open a :New Issue: with the `feature` label.

## Library
* Prefabs integration (when they finally come out).
* Automatic data initialization - convenience with performance cost.
* Deferred loading over time for heavy rooms with many elements.
* `.Part(left, top, right, bottom)` state - :Loading: and :Screenshotting: parts of rooms. 
* Pixel-based :Origin: mode instead of 0-1 relative percentage.
* Particle systems support (GM bug?).
* In-layer Filters/Effects support (GM bug?).

## Demos
* Autotiling rooms.
* Drag'n'drop map.
* Endless runner.
