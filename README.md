# Overview
GMRoomLoader is a pure GML [Free and Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) GameMaker library made for creating room prefabs and loading room contents at runtime, AKA "loading other rooms into the current room".

It provides tools to process the data returned by [room_get_info()](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/room_get_info.htm), use that data to load room contents efficiently during gameplay, and clean up created elements when needed.

* Download the `.yymps` package from the [Releases](https://github.com/glebtsereteli/GMRoomLoader/releases) page.
* Refer to the [Documentation](https://glebtsereteli.github.io/GMRoomLoader/) for full API reference and usage examples.
