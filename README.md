<h1 align="center">GMRoomLoader v1.0.0</h1>
<p align="center">Runtime room loading for GameMaker 2023.11+</p>

## Overview
GMRoomLoader streamlines the process of loading GameMaker rooms at runtime with minimal setup required. It provides a set of methods to cache the data returned by [room_get_info()](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/room_get_info.htm), load it efficiently during gameplay, and clean it up when needed.
