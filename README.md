<h1 align="center">GMRoomLoader v1.0.0</h1>
<p align="center">For GameMaker 2023.11+ by Gleb Tsereteli</p>

## Overview
GMRoomLoader streamlines the process of loading GameMaker rooms at runtime with minimal setup. It provides a set of methods to cache the data returned by [room_get_info()](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/room_get_info.htm), load it efficiently during gameplay and clean it up when needed.
* Download the package (.yymps) and demo project (.yyz) from the [Releases](https://github.com/glebtsereteli/GMRoomLoader/releases) tab.
* Refer to the [Wiki](https://youtu.be/hvL1339luv0?si=V5h979LwTKAaKErY) for detailed documentation.
