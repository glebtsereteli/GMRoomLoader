# GMRoomLoader v2.5.0 Demo

## Welcome!

Welcome to the [GMRoomLoader](https://github.com/glebtsereteli/GMRoomLoader) demo project!

This project showcases the core functionality of the library. It's designed as a feature demonstration and reference, not a tutorial.

If you are looking for a simple example to load your first room, please refer to the [First Setup](https://glebtsereteli.github.io/GMRoomLoader/pages/home/demosTutorials/demosTutorials#first-setup) project instead, and check out the available [Tutorials](https://glebtsereteli.github.io/GMRoomLoader/pages/home/demosTutorials/demosTutorials#tutorials).

## What's Included
The demo project includes interactive examples covering most features of the library.

It also features a DBG ImGui control panel that allows you to cycle through demos and access custom controls for each example.

Learn more about the demo in the [Demo Documentation](https://glebtsereteli.github.io/GMRoomLoader/pages/home/demosTutorials/demosTutorials#demo-project).
